    <h2>Code Kata - Atari</h2>
    
    
<p>This <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">Code Kata</a> was set by <a href="https://cumulative-hypotheses.org/">Keith Braithwaite</a>, at his session TDD As If You Meant It, during Software Craftsmanship 2009.</p>

<p>The challenge is taken from the game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>.  Go is played by two players who alternately place black and white stones on the vacant intersections of a grid of 19×19 lines.  A stone is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_terms">atari</a> if a stone or chain of stones has only one liberty.  The <a href="http://www.telgo.com/">liberty</a> is the number of vacant points that are adjacent to a stone or connected group of same coloured stones (diagonals do not count).  Some example configurations, with their liberty, are shown in the following pictures:</p>

<img title="two adjacent stones with a liberty of 4" alt="two adjacent stones with a liberty of 4" src="images/Liberty3.png" />
<img title="two adjacent stones with a liberty of 3" alt="two adjacent stones with a liberty of 3" src="images/Liberty4.png" />
<p>

<p>The Kata is to calculate whether a stone is atari, for an arbitrary collection of stones.</p>

<p>Keith had some rules about how you should proceed with coding, which define an extreme limit of TDD:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Write exactly ONE failing test.</li>
	<li>Make the test from (1) pass by first writing implementation code IN THE TEST.</li>
	<li>Create a new implementation method/function by:
<ul>
	<li>doing extract method on implementation code created as per (2), or</li>
	<li>moving implementation code as per (2) into an existing implementation method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Only ever create new methods IN THE TEST CLASS.</li>
	<li>Only ever create implementation classes to provide a destination for extracting a method created as per (4).</li>
	<li>Populate implementation classes by doing move method from a test class into them.</li>
	<li>Refactor as required.</li>
	<li>Go to (1).</li>
</ol>
