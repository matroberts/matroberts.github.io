    <h2>Randomizing Output</h2>
    
    
<p>Coding Horror asks the question <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/08/whats-on-your-utility-belt.html">what's on your utility belt?</a>, or "what do you take with you when you go out?"  So here's my answer:</p>

<p><img alt="postit pencil dice" title="postit pencil dice" src="images/postit-pencil-dice.jpg"></p>
<ul>
	<li>Post-It notes - I like the traditional yellow.  For me they have a greater versatility than electronic counterparts - after all I just want to jot things down, not write a book.  The other problem with electronic note taking, is message-medium confusion.  By the time I've started up the note taking machine, and opened the little app, I've forgotten what I want to write.  It's even worse if it's a bit of math or a little picture.  Even more ceremony.  I can also stick the Post-It's into the analogue book I'm reading.</li>
	<li>Pencil - mechanical obviously.  My current favourite is a Faber Castel GRIP PLUS 0.7.  I find the 0.7 mm diameter graphite more satisfying to write with than the more common 0.5mm pencil.  I also prefer a 2B lead, but they are difficult to buy so I normally settle for HB.  The Faber has also got an excellent eraser.</li>
	<li>Dice - for when I need to randomize my output.  Humans find it almost impossible to think of random numbers, but often the optimal strategy is to behave randomly, hence the need for a portable random number generator.</li>
</ul>
