    <h2>Functions as First Class Objects</h2>
    
    
<p>In Scheme, and other functional programming languages, functions are "First Class Objects".  But what does that mean?  </p>

<p>An object is first class if it can be <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3540/sessions/session05.html#first-class-functions">treated the same way as a value</a>, that is it <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3540/sessions/session06.html#perlis">can be</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Named.</li>
	<li>Assigned to a variable.</li>
	<li>Passed to a procedure.</li>
	<li>Returned from a procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having functions as first class objects provides another dimension for program abstraction.  A procedure which receives a procedure as an input or generates a procedure as an output, is called a <em>higher order</em> procedure.</p>

<p>Another feature in practice of functional programming is the <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/parallel/mapreduce-tutorial.html#MapReduce">map-reduce pattern</a>.  In map-reduce an algorithm is split into two parts, the "map" where a calculation is done on each element in a list, and the "reduce" where the result of the individual calculations are aggregated.  </p>

<p>Scheme has two methods which help implement simple cases of map-reduce:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Map - Takes a procedure and a list as arguments, and returns a list containing the result of applying the procedure to <strong>each</strong> item in the list.</li>
	<li>Apply - Takes a procedure and a list as arguments, and returns the result of calling the procedure with <strong>all</strong> the values in the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>So say you want to calculate the sum of the squares of a bunch of numbers:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-scheme">
(define square
  (lambda (x)
    (* x x)))

(define sum-of-squares
 (lambda x 
   (apply + (map square x))))

(sum-of-squares 2 2 2)

=> 12
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, say you want to calculate the sum of the cubes of a bunch of numbers.  Well you could just copy the sum-of-squares function, change the name and change the call to square to a call to cube:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-scheme">
(define cube
  (lambda (x)
    (* x x x)))

(define sum-of-cube
 (lambda x 
   (apply + (map cube x))))

(sum-of-cube 3 3 3)
=> 27
</code>
</pre>

<p>But you can see most of the sum-of-squares and sum-of-cubes functions are the same, only differing by the function which gets called.  You can remove the duplication by exploiting first class functions.  Define a sum-of-func procedure, which takes the function you want to apply as an argument, and returns a sum-of function as its result:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-scheme">
(define sum-of-func
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda x
      (apply + (map f x)))))
</code>
</pre>

<p>You use the higher-order procedure sum-of-func like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-scheme">
(define sum-of-square (sum-of-func square))
(sum-of-square 2 2 2)
=> 12

(define sum-of-cube (sum-of-func cube))
(sum-of-cube 3 3 3)
=> 27
</code>
</pre>

<p>It's really quite beautiful.</p>
