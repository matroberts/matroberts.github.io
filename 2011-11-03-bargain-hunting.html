<h2>Bargain Hunting</h2>

    
<p>When I go shopping I have a <em>no turning back rule</em> - I won't go back to buy something I've already seen.  Either buy it now, or move on and don't come back.  The rule is designed to force a decision, and stop over deliberation.</p>

<p>It does raise a bit of a problem though; I'm worried about not getting the best deal.  I have just learnt a strategy which copes with this bizarre behaviour.  I read about it in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/046501884X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=struggforcomp-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=046501884X">The Perfect Swarm</a> by Len Fisher, though he says he got it from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0195143817/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=struggforcomp-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0195143817">Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart</a>.</p>

<p>When you're shopping for a bargain, and can't go back and choose a previous item:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Set a maximum number of things to look at.</li>
 <li>Look at the first 7% of items, making a note of the price but not buying.</li>
 <li>Continue browsing, and choose the next thing which has the lowest price so far.</li>
 <li>This heuristic gives a 92% chance of buying an item in the cheapest 25%.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have more stamina, look at the first 14% then choose the next one with the lowest price so far.  This gives an 84% chance of buying a item in the cheapest 10%.</p>

<p>I have another rule to protect myself after purchase.  The <em>ignorance is bliss rule</em> - after buying something do not look at any more prices.  Definitely don't go in any shops selling the same sort of thing, and preferably go straight home.  I never take anything back, so it's better not know that a better bargain may exist.</p>
