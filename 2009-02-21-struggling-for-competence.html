    <h2>Struggling for Competence</h2>
    
    
<p>I've been developing software professionally for about 10 years.</p>

<p>I find software development quite difficult, in fact a struggle.  My ignorance is exposed daily, there are not enough tests, the design is....suboptimal, and there's that thing when it's just much more difficult than it should be.  I do want to get better though; improve my competence.</p>

<p>I believe that Software Engineering involves cutting code.  In his essay <a href="http://www.bleading-edge.com/Publications/C++Journal/Cpjour2.htm">What is Software Design?</a>, Jack Reeves develops the idea that writing code is a <em>design</em> activity.  The premise is that the source code provides the ultimate specification of the system.  The compiler takes this specification and from it creates the product; the executable.  <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign">The Source Code is the Design</a>.  A controversial view - perhaps.</p>

<p>Software clearly has a quality problem.  Everybody has experience of tools which don't install correctly, and tools which don't work correctly.  Hey, if you develop software I bet you've created tools like this too - I have.  For me <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321146530?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=struggforcomp-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0321146530">Test Driven Development</a> (TDD) is "The Way" - the solution to this quality problem.  I want all the code I write to be under automated test.  This is currently only a goal though, not a reality.  Understanding how to best deal with external interfaces, in particular the database and  UI, represents an ongoing learning process.</p>

<p>All of the technologies and tools I now use, I have learnt in the past 4 years.  All the framework and tooling knowledge I have from before this period is completely irrelevant.  Clearly in software development you must make a commitment to learning throughout your career.  Currently I work on the Microsoft stack, building web based applications.  To do the job properly, you need to have capability across the whole stack; productivity occurs when you know something well.  One of my current aims to deepen my knowledge of this technology, so I choose, for now at least, to focus on: Windows, IIS, SQL Server, C#, Asp.net and JavaScript/JQuery.</p>

<p>My aims here are modest. I am not aiming to be a great programmer, just a competent developer.</p>
